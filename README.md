# Speech-Enhancer Service

This project aims to enhance speech from m4a audio clips (recorded from iphones) by using dynamic audio range compression, high-pass filtering, and rnnoise noise reducer.

The dynamic audio range compression algorithm will be translated from C to rust (performance and compatibility with python).

Planned to be deployed on AWS using docker and FastAPI
